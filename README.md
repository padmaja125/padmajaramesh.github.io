## Projects

### Healthcare Workforce Analysis

#### Overview

This project focuses on analyzing healthcare workforce shortages using datasets from the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA). The analysis includes key metrics such as total HPSA areas, population below poverty, and withdrawn designations, as well as visualizations to provide insights into healthcare workforce distribution and shortages.

#### Data Sources

The data used in this analysis were obtained from the Kaggle website and include:

- [HPSA Dataset for Dental Health](https://data.hrsa.gov//DataDownload/DD_Files/BCD_HPSA_FCT_DET_DH.csv)
- [HPSA Dataset for Mental Health](https://data.hrsa.gov//DataDownload/DD_Files/BCD_HPSA_FCT_DET_MH.csv)
- [HPSA Dataset for Physical Health](https://data.hrsa.gov//DataDownload/DD_Files/BCD_HPSA_FCT_DET_PC.csv)

#### Analysis and Insights

1. **Total HPSA Areas**
   - **Visualization:** Card
   - **Insight:** Displays the total count of HPSA areas, highlighting the extent of healthcare shortages across regions.

2. **Total Population Below Poverty**
   - **Visualization:** Card
   - **Insight:** Shows the total population below poverty, emphasizing the socioeconomic challenges that exacerbate healthcare shortages.

3. **Total Withdrawn Designations**
   - **Visualization:** Card
   - **Insight:** Highlights the areas where healthcare providers have left, indicating regions struggling to retain healthcare professionals.

4. **Geographical Distribution Map**
   - **Visualization:** Map
   - **Insight:** Visualizes the geographical distribution of HPSA areas, pinpointing regions with the most significant shortages.

5. **Stacked Bar Chart: HPSA Name and HPSA Areas**
   - **Visualization:** Stacked Bar Chart
   - **Insight:** Provides a breakdown of the number of HPSA areas for each HPSA name, highlighting the distribution of shortage areas across different healthcare domains.

6. **Line Chart: Trend Analysis of HPSA Designations Over Time**
   - **Visualization:** Line Chart
   - **Insight:** Shows trends in HPSA designations over time, identifying periods of increase or decrease in designations.

7. **Stacked Bar Chart: Distribution of Population Below Poverty by Region and State**
   - **Visualization:** Stacked Bar Chart
   - **Insight:** Highlights regions and states with high poverty levels, correlating with greater healthcare needs.

8. **Pie Chart: HPSA Designation Status Breakdown**
   - **Visualization:** Pie Chart
   - **Insight:** Displays the status of HPSA designations (active vs. withdrawn), indicating areas that may need policy review or support programs.

9. **Bar Chart: Provider to Population Ratio**
   - **Visualization:** Bar Chart
   - **Insight:** Shows the provider-to-population ratio by region and state, highlighting areas with severe provider shortages.

10. **Interactive Filtering with Slicers**
    - **Slicers:** State
    - **Insight:** Allows users to explore the dataset by specific states, providing a customizable and interactive experience.
